# Claude Code Documentation Series

## Important Notice

This documentation series is based on **reverse-engineering** of Claude Code's internal implementation. As such:

- The information presented may not be 100% accurate
- Some details may be incomplete or missing due to the inherent limitations of reverse-engineering
- Internal implementation details may have been lost or misinterpreted during the deobfuscation process
- Function names, variable names, and architectural descriptions are best-effort interpretations

## Purpose

This series aims to provide insights into Claude Code's architecture and implementation patterns based on analysis of the deobfuscated codebase. It should be used as a reference guide with the understanding that:

1. The actual implementation may differ from what is documented
2. Some behaviors described may be approximations or educated guesses
3. The documentation reflects the state of version 1.0.115 and may not apply to other versions

## Contents

The series covers various aspects of Claude Code's implementation including:

- Core architecture and components
- Agent systems and task management
- File handling and project management
- Testing and quality assurance
- Internal protocols and communication patterns

## Disclaimer

This documentation is provided as-is for educational and reference purposes. Users should verify any critical information through their own analysis and testing.
